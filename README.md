# Airbnb-Analysis
This project is a descriptive analysis on an Airbnb dataset for business owners which was extracted from Kaggle.

The aim of the project is to develop insights from the previous data to present suitable solutions to new and existing business owners.

The research questions are: 
1. What are the top 30 words used by New York Airbnb hosts in their neighborhood overview? What do they imply? (R language) 
2. Is there any correlation between the price and the number of amenities? What are the top most popular amenities that business owners list in their accommodation? (Python) 
3. Does the sincerity of the Airbnb owners in terms of actual location promised, affect the ratings? Which borough Airbnb owners are more sincere? (SAS Language) 

A simple data validation, cleaning and manipulation was processed on the data using Excel. The data exploration are done based on the research questions using several tools which includes R, Python and SAS Studio.
